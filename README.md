Jast simple PHP application - MVC blog 
--------------------------------------

The application should be a blog which allows user to create\edit\list and delete posts. 
No authorization or user management are required.

# Requirements:
- usage of frameworks or 3rd-party libraries is not allowed (composer or other tools are ok);
- at least 1 controller;
- at least 1 model;
- a view renderer;
- a view helper support (optional);
- a simple router;
- the app must operate with models, eg. "$db->fetchPosts()" should return Model[] and not an array; (object ???)
- DI (dependency injection) container is a plus;
- UI must be done using Twitter Bootstrap 3.

The core of this app should be easily used to build an another app.

Publish project to github and also provide an amount of spent time.
